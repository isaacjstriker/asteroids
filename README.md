## Asteroids
This is a simple Asteroids game implemented in Python using Pygame.
It's my first project for Boot.dev!

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pygame (see requirements.txt)

## How to Run Locally
Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd asteroids
```

OR (if you have GitHub CLI)

```sh
gh repo clone isaacjstriker/maze_solver
```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the game:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Gameplay
- Use WASD to move and rotate your ship.
- Press Space to shoot.
- Avoid asteroids and try to survive as long as possible!

Enjoy playing, and thanks for checking out my first Boot.dev project!
